#### Paragraph
web application architecture is crucial for building robust and scalable web applications. It essentially defines the blueprint for how various components of your application interact with each other. Choosing the right architecture depends on the specific needs and complexity of your web application. A well-defined architecture is the foundation for building secure, maintainable, and scalable web applications that can thrive in the ever-evolving digital landscape. 

#### Today we will see various web application architectures like: 

1) Monolithic, Modular Monolithic 
2) 2 Tier, N Tier 
3) Microservice 
4) Event-Driven 
5) Cloud-Native 
6) Serverless etc 

####
There are many such architectures. What are the key characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of these architectures, and which architecture will be best for which work, that is, how can we choose the perfect architecture? We will learn in detail about all these in today's lecture. And through this, the System Design Workshop is starting. If you liked the video, don't forget to share it with your friends.
